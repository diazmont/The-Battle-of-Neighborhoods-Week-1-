It is the largest city in the United States with a long history of international immigration. New York City has been a major point of entry for immigrants and as many as 800 languages are spoken in New York. New data from the U.S. Census reveal that Mexicans are New York City's fastest growing ethnic group. New York City's Mexican population ranked 11th among major U.S. cities in 2000 at 186,872, a figure that rivals the size of long-standing Mexican communities like San Diego, Santa Ana, and San Jose, California. Mexican migrants, in particular, have generally been successful in opening restaurants and creating jobs in New York. Mexican food is one of the defining characteristics of Mexican culture and have an special niche in serving distinct flavors and ingredients of each region of the country and the culinary traditions of each. \n\nThis capstone project examines the best locations for Mexican restaurants in New York City. Intricate and intimate migrant networks have developed over the years between New York City and specific communities in Mexico. As family members and friends from these communities move back and forth between the two countries, they facilitate the flow of information. The result is that news about extremely popular locations in New York are quickly transmitted to potential new restaurant owners looking to have great success and steady profit. Nevertheless, like any other business, opening a new restaurant requires serious considerations and is more complicated than it seems at first. Location influences the success or failure of a restaurant in a host of ways, from attracting enough initial customer interest to being convenient to visit. \n\nThe objective of this capstone project is to analyze and select the best locations in New York City to open a new Mexican restaurant by analyzing and visualizing data, building a model, and understanding the feedback after model deployment. The project is particularly useful to new Mexican migrants looking to open and invest on new restaurant in New York City. New York City was home to over 8.3 million people in 2019 and keeps growing as diverse city in terms of culture and food offering.

Foursquare API will be necessary to obtain venue data of New York City neighborhoods. Currently Foursquare's database contains more than 105 million places including venue data such as Mexican restaurants in New York City.\n\nThe capstone project will show how to convert addresses into their equivalent latitude and longitude values. Also, how to use the Foursquare API to explore neighborhoods in New York City, use the explore function to get the most common venue categories in each neighborhood, and then use this feature to group the neighborhoods into clusters. Finally, the importance of machine learning clustering algorithm to complete the task and the use of Folium library to visualize the neighborhoods in New York City and their emerging clusters.
